###Maze Generator
Abstracted from [Daniel Shiffman](http://codingrainbow.com/ "Daniel Shiffman's Homepage"). If you don't know who he is, look what he's doing on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman). He's doin some pretty fun visualizations and algorithms.

I refactored his maze generator into some different classes to make a maze game using some other concepts from p5 (loading images, changing grid colors, simulating player turns ect). Ideally, you probably wouldn't want to use p5 to make an entire html game from scratch (or at least I think) . You'd most likely use a  framework like [phaser.io](http://phaser.io/) or [easljs](http://www.createjs.com/easeljs) that handles sprites and collisions - but p5 has an immense amount of tools to learn the basics.
