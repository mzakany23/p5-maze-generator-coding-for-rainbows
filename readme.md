###Maze Generator
Abstracted from [Daniel Shiffman](http://codingrainbow.com/ "Daniel Shiffman's Homepage"). If you don't know who he is, look what he's doing on youtube. He's a pretty epic guy and I love watching his videos.
I better refactored the maze generator into Grid and Cell classes and some color pickers. Step one makes a random maze n by n - and step two allows user to solve maze once it's finished writing itself. In process writing second part.
